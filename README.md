### Introduction

The main analysis code used in the article titled "Boosting the power of rare variant association studies by imputation using large-scale sequencing population". This part of the code includes analysis scripts for processing association analysis results, evaluating genotype consistency and generating figures.

### Brief description of the analysis code.
- Association tests for rare variants.R : used to process the results of association analysis for rare variants under different datasets, including screening for significant variants.
- Genotype consistency evaluation.R : used to evaluate consistency between imputed data and WGS data in different ethnicities.
- Plotting code for Fig2-3. R : codes for generating Figure 2 and Figure 3.
- Plotting code for Fig4-5. R : codes for generating Figure 4 and Figure 5.
- Processing meta data.sh : used to process two types of cancer data after meta analyses.
-False Positive Rate for imputed data (30 bio).R : used to calculate the false positive rate of association analysis results of 30 biochemistry biomarkers in two imputed data (n=150k).
